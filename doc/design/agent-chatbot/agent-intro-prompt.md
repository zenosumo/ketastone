Prepare a mockup page for chat assistant.
Scope: only what the user sees and interacts with, not implementation.
Requirements Layout: a container that holds the entire chat experience.
Conversation area: a vertical timeline where messages stack top-to-bottom.
User messages visually distinct from bot messages (e.g. alignment, color). Support for text, code blocks, and rich formatting. Scrolling area with sticky scroll-to-bottom on new messages.
Composer: input bar fixed at bottom of container. Single-line text entry, expands with content. Press Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline. Dedicated “Send” button on the right. Conversation header: simple bar at top with session title and optional subtitle. Status indicators: “Bot is typing” animation under the last bot message. Error banner inline if a message fails. Empty state: when no messages yet, show onboarding hint or example prompts in the conversation area. Controls next to messages: “Retry,” “Edit & resend,” optional “Copy.” Accessibility: clear color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles for chat regions. Responsiveness: works both desktop and mobile view; input bar and messages adapt to width. Deliverables A clean UI mockup showing container, header, conversation timeline, composer, and status/error elements. Design should emphasize clarity, simplicity, and modern chat aesthetics.
